# Denver-Nuggets-2020-Playoff-Analysis
This is a short data visualizations project which looks at how Denver overcame two consecutive 1-3 series deficits during the 2020 NBA Playoffs.
## To Run:
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the requirements.txt file if you are working in a virtual environment
3. Run each of the Jupyter notebooks
4. Run the R script to generate each of the visualizations
## Note:
I will do more work on this repository so that each csv file and data visualization ends up in either a folder for data or a folder for visualizations.
