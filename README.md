# Denver-Nuggets-2020-Playoff-Analysis
This is a short data visualizations project which looks at how Denver overcame two consecutive 1-3 series deficits during the 2020 NBA Playoffs.
## To Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the requirements.txt file if you are working in a virtual environment.
3. Run each of the Jupyter notebooks.
4. Run the R script to generate each of the visualizations (change the working directory to the directory in which you cloned the repository).
5. Run CompressionCommands.txt in your local terminal to create a 2x2 grid of the animated visualizations. You will need to make sure you have *ffmpeg* installed first.
## Note:
I will do more work on this repository so that each csv file and data visualization ends up in either a folder for data or a folder for visualizations.
